  <h1> CodeClan - About me</h1>

  <div class="index wrap">

    <div class="indextext">
      <p>My name is Ann-marie, up until now I have worked in the retail sector.
        In the past I have worked for HMV and Trespass.
        I am looking forward to getting involved in the Tech industry and excited to see where it will
        take me. I decided that Codeclan was the right way forward. I studied Multimedia Technology at
        Glasgow Caledonian University and have a little bit of a background in software development.
        However my knowledge is fairly dusty and things have moved on since I last studied, I'm looking forward to
        learning what has changed. I've enjoyed creating this page and would like to progress further in the future.

      <p> I live in Glasgow with my boyfriend Colin.
        In my spare time I like to go see bands and buy records.
        Most recently seeing the Cure at the southbank centre for Robert Smiths Meltdown. </p>
